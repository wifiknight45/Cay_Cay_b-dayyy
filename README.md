# Caydence’s Super Cool 11th Birthday Website! 🎉

## Hello, Friends!
Welcome to a magical website made just for Caydence’s 11th birthday! She’s turning 11 tomorrow, April 14, 2025, and we’re having a big party today in Springfield, Missouri. This site is like a secret door from *Coraline*, her favorite movie, full of fun surprises!

## What’s This Website About?
This website is a special place to celebrate Caydence! She was born in California but lives in Missouri now, and she LOVES *Coraline* because it’s spooky and awesome. Here, you can:
- Read about Caydence’s birthday party.
- Leave sweet birthday messages for her and your friends.
- Find cool secrets about *Coraline* (like the buttons or the tiny door!).

## How to Use It
1. **Look Around**: When you open the website, you’ll see a big “Happy Birthday, Caydence!” message. It fades in like magic!
2. **Click Buttons**: There are two fun buttons that bounce like they’re alive!
   - One says “Leave a Birthday Wish!”—click it to write something nice.
   - The other says “Discover a Coraline Secret”—click it for a fun fact!
3. **Write Messages**:
   - Find the “Birthday Message Board” part.
   - Type your name (like “Emma” or “Liam”).
   - Write a message, like “Happy birthday, Caydence! You’re the best!”
   - Click the “Post Message” button, and your message will show up for everyone to see!
4. **Have Fun**: The website looks like *Coraline*’s world, with dark blues and pretty pinks. It works on phones, tablets, or computers, so you can use it at the party!

## Cool Things to Notice
- **Magic Animations**: The top part of the page appears like a ghost (poof!), and the buttons bounce up and down like they’re dancing.
- **Messages Stay**: If you write a message, it stays on the website even if you close it and come back later (unless someone cleans the computer’s memory).
- **Coraline Vibes**: The colors and secrets make you feel like you’re in *Coraline*’s house, but don’t worry—it’s not scary, just fun!

## How to Find the Website
Ask a grown-up to open the website on a computer or phone. It’s like a birthday card online! If they need help, tell them it’s on a special place called GitHub Pages (but you don’t need to know that part).

## Who Made This?
This was made with lots of love for Caydence by her friend’s grown-up helper. We wanted her 11th birthday to feel like a *Coraline* adventure!

## If Something Doesn’t Work
If the website acts funny, tell a grown-up to check if the internet is on. If the messages disappear, it’s okay—they’re still in your heart!

Happy birthday, Caydence! Let’s party! 🥳
