# Caydence’s Awesome 11th Birthday Website! 🎉

## Hello there friends and family!
Welcome to Caydence’s birthday website! It’s a fun place to celebrate her turning 11 tomorrow, April 14, 2025. Today, April 13, we’re having a small party, and you’re invited to join the fun online! This site is full of cool stuff Caydence loves, like *Coraline*, Chappell Roan’s music, and making wild, colorful bead bracelets.

## What’s This Website For?
This website is like a giant birthday card for Caydence! You can:
- Read about her special day.
- Write birthday messages that zoom onto the screen.
- Learn about Chappell Roan’s sparkly music.
- Check out hit songs from when Caydence was born.
- Find out how to make a cool bead bracelet!

## How to Use It
1. **Open the Website**: Ask a grown-up to visit the website on a phone or computer. It’s like opening a present!
2. **Look at the Top**: You’ll see “Happy 11th Birthday, Caydence!” pop up like magic. That’s the first surprise!
3. **Click Fun Buttons**: There are two buttons that bounce like they’re dancing:
   - **“Leave a Birthday Wish!”**: Click this to write something nice for Caydence.
   - **“Discover a Chappell Roan Fact”**: Click to learn something cool about her favorite singer!
4. **Write a Message**:
   - Scroll to the “Birthday Message Board.”
   - Type your name (like “Zoe” or “Max”).
   - Write a message, like “Happy birthday, Caydence! Your bracelets rock!”
   - Hit “Post Message,” and watch your message slide in from the side—wooosh!
   - Every time you post, a special file saves your message so Caydence can read it later.
5. **Explore More**:
   - **Songs**: See popular songs from 2014, like “Happy,” that were big when Caydence was a baby.
   - **Bracelets**: Follow steps to make a colorful bead bracelet, just like Caydence loves.
6. **Have a Blast**: The website is all pink and sparkly, like a Chappell Roan concert!

## Super Cool Things to Spot
- **Moving Stuff**: The website has three awesome moves:
  1. The top part fades in like a birthday candle lighting up.
  2. The buttons bounce up and down like they’re excited for the party.
  3. Messages slide in from the left when you post them—super speedy!
- **Messages Save**: Your messages stay on the website for the party. They also get saved in a file called `caydence_birthday_messages.txt` that pops up on the computer. Ask a grown-up to keep it for Caydence!
- **Fun Facts**: Learn about Chappell Roan, like how she loves sparkly outfits.
- **Bracelet Time**: Make a bracelet with wild colors to match Caydence’s style.

## How to Find It
Tell a grown-up to open the website. It’s waiting for you at a special address (like a secret clubhouse)! If they need help, say it’s on “GitHub Pages,” but you don’t need to worry about that.

## Who Made It?
This website was made with lots of love for Caydence by her Mom's longtime friend Robert aka "Roberto" who has known Caydence's mom since before she was even born! Yes, some people were actually born in the previous century lol. We wanted Caydence's 11th birthday to be as wild and colorful as her bracelets

## If It Acts Silly
If the website doesn’t work right (like if messages don’t slide), tell a grown-up to check the internet or refresh the page. It’s all good—parties are about fun, not worries!

Let’s make Caydence’s birthday the best ever! 🥳
